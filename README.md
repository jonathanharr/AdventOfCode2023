# Advent of Code 2023 - Python Deep Dive
Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository! This is my personal challenge to tackle Advent of Code (AoC) puzzles while enhancing my Python skills. Each day, I aimed to solve complex problems, expanding my expertise in tech and exploring Python's capabilities in depth.

## About This Repository
This repo documents my solutions for the first 9 days of Advent of Code 2023. Each folder corresponds to a day's puzzle, containing Python code that showcases various approaches and techniques. I leveraged this challenge to dive deeper into Python, from handling data structures and algorithms to implementing efficient, Pythonic solutions.

## Structure
Day 01 to Day 09: Each directory includes:
- .py file(s) (one to many depending on the needs of the challenge itself)
- input file in the form of a .txt-file.

## Goals and Reflections
Expand Python Skills: Beyond just solving the puzzles, I worked to make my code more efficient, readable, and Pythonic.
Problem Solving: Each puzzle offered unique problem-solving opportunities, which I approached with creativity and a focus on best practices.
Learning by Doing: This repository is a testament to learning through hands-on coding, encountering challenges, and exploring solutions.
